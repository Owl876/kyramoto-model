# Kyramoto Model

A Python implementation of the Kyramoto model, focusing on the coefficients of linkage in different scenarios.

## Introduction

The Kyramoto model explores the coefficients of linkage between entities. This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate different aspects of the model.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Owl876/kyramoto-model.git
```

## Usage

Physics 5_1

The script physics_5_1.py calculates the coefficient of linkage "in front," which weakens uniformly as it moves away from the first entity.

Physics 5_2

The script physics_5_2.py calculates the coefficient of linkage "behind," which weakens exponentially as it moves forward from the last entity.
